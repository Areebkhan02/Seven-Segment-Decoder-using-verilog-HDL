# Seven-Segment-Decoder-using-verilog-HDL
Implement the Binary-coded hexadecimal to 7 segment decoder for seven-segment display.
It is called a decoder because it takes the four inputs (a BCD) and decodes them into seven outputs, which are then used to drive one or more of the seven segments of the seven-segment display to show the desired number.
